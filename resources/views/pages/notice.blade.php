            <p>
                Admission is largely based on merits, a proven academic success, the potential contributions a student can bring to the community,
                and an enthusiasm for learning. We enroll students every year to fulfill the vacant seats available on
                merit base. Admission shall not be denied because of nationality, ethnicity, gender, or religious beliefs.
